      <h2>What i did</h2>
      <p>
        I played a pivotal role in the development of the SkinSense Pro app by
        leading its design, ensuring a user-friendly and visually appealing
        interface. I integrated Firebase as the backend to manage data
        seamlessly and implemented robust user authentication for secure access.
        Additionally, I developed the barcode scanning feature, enabling users
        to quickly access product information by simply scanning barcodes. My
        contributions bridged technical functionality with a sleek design,
        delivering a cohesive and efficient skincare assistant app tailored to
        user needs.
